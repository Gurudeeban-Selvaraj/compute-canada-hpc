File- 2. (QED_calculation):# Quantitative Estimation of Drug-likeness (QED) is a metric that helps evaluate the "drug-likeness" of small molecules based on a combination of molecular properties. 
It integrates several attributes such as molecular weight, lipophilicity (logP), polar surface area (PSA), number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, number of rotatable bonds, and number of aromatic rings.
